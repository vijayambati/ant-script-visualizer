# How to build the Ant Script Visualizer #

A build script is included (in the build directory).  For convenience, a `build.cmd` and `build.sh`.  You will need to tweak these to work with your configuration for Windows.

To build the project, simply run the "all" target, like so:
`build all` for Windows, or `./build.sh all` for OS X and Linux.
