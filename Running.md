# How to run the Ant Script Visualizer #
There are several ways to run the app:
  1. From the bulid script - `build run`
  1. From a comand line - `runme.bat` or `runme.sh`
  1. From your IDE - the main class is `com.nurflugel.util.antscriptvisualizer.AntParserUiImpl`
  1. If you don't want to build it, the preferred option would be to run it from Java WebStart.  It's hosted on my web site : http://www.nurflugel.com/webstart/AntScriptVisualizer/antscriptVisualizer.jnlp
